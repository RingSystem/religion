Welcome to religion! We seek to fix the flaws in old-time religions, create new rituals, and increase the human experience. 


The 3 sections of this initial repository are: 
- Maxims 
- Music 
- Mumblings
Maxims is a list of maxims that aims to increase harmony within your life. 

Music is a bit of a dog's breakfast of musical rituals one can perform. 

Mumblings is an even less ordered selection of ephemera and oddities. 


We're  attempting to stay relatively up-to-date with the modern moral gestalt, while eschewing the failtures of other religions, primarily Christianity. 
Additionally, rituals have been updated for the modern age. 

In this way, religion is the first post-Abrahamic religion.

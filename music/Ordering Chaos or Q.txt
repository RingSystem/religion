To quantize or not to quantize (to Q or not to Q)is a deep philosophical quandary. 
For the purposes of this discussion, quantization will refer to locking the tonal output of your voice into a particular way of deriving the pitches. While this is most commonly a scale within the 12TET system,
just intonation may also accidentally be involved. 

By accepting Q, you are damned to abide by it for the duration of the invocation. You may speak, but not with the resonance of your soul, instead, the weaker resonances within others.

By denying Q, you invite dissonance and retribution with the careless turn of a dial or millimeter-misplaced fingerboard finger, but are most free to perform the resonance of your soul. 

Ideally, an acolyte of religion should be able to perform not only the local dialectical scales, but also a selection of scales from across the world. The pelog and slendro scales of Indonesia are as good a 
starting place as any. 

Creating new scales is also a worthwhile endeavour. 

Avoid the prison cell of 12TET octave-repeating scales, beyond what is required to speak with local musicians.

The first ritual shall be as such:

First, find the resonance of your soul. 
Secondly, sing the resonance of your soul. 
Thirdly, store the resonance of your soul. 
Fourth, transmit the resonance of your soul. 



Contrary to the verbiage, soul resonance can be sung by any instrument, in any key or mode of tones. 

As far as methods of storing and transmitting soul resonance, the best available that cannot bring malice to your house is magnetic tape, however, in a pinch, audio files are acceptable, as long as those files are transmitted over the Web.
